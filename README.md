# Potato Leaf Disease Detection

This project aims to detect diseases in potato leaves using deep learning techniques. The model is trained on a dataset of potato leaf images and can accurately classify different types of diseases.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Flask
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

## Project Structure

- `app.py`: Flask application to serve the model.
- `model/`: Directory containing the trained model.
- `static/`: Contains static files like CSS, JS, and images.
- `templates/`: HTML templates for the Flask app.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Anujjhariya/potato-leaf-disease-detection.git
2. pip install -r requirements.txt
3. python main5.py
